# iOSSC

[![swift-version](https://img.shields.io/badge/swift-5.3-orange.svg)](https://github.com/apple/swift)
[![platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-iOS-lightgrey)]()

A iOS client application for retrieving your Grades from the OSSC servers.

This application works in conjunction with my node-ossc web server which recives and processes the grades page provided by the OSSC.
The Server then returns a developer friendly JSON object back to the client application. 

The endpoint for the API is located at [https://api.kuhlti.me/ossc/modules](https://api.kuhlti.me/ossc/modules).

### Web App

Besides the iOS Client there is also a web based application available. Check out: [https://hsd.kuhlti.me](https://hsd.kuhlti.me)
