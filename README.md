# iOSSC
A iOS client application for retrieving your Grades from the OSSC servers.

This application works in conjunction with my node-ossc web server which recives and process the grades page provided by the OSSC and returns a developer friendly JSON object.

The endpoint for the API is located at [https://api.kuhlti.me/ossc/modules](https://api.kuhlti.me/ossc/modules).

### Web App

Besides the iOS Client there is also a web based application available. Check out: [https://hsd.kuhlti.me](https://hsd.kuhlti.me)
